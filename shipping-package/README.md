`In this project we made a library with the common code that we will
use in two related projects: Client and Server, where we will work
with Sockets.`

<br>

Shipping package was based on reading the YouTube Java course "Computer Pills",
however, you will appreciate that I have made several modifications
in order to make it more efficient (for example, in the reuse of
sockets), as well as I have applied various knowledge acquired for
the purpose of improving the user experience.
