In this case, it implies the request to communicate using MyChat
with another Client through the Server.

MyChat was based on reading the YouTube Java course "Computer Pills",
however, you will appreciate that I have made several modifications
in order to make it more efficient (for example, in the reuse of
sockets), as well as I have applied various knowledge acquired for
the purpose of improving the user experience.
